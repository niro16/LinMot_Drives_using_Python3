# LinMot_Drives_using_Python3

LinRS.py is a python script I have made to test LinMot drives. The script is made to only run in a few motion modes. Feel free to use the code if you want it.

To use this code, make sure to use LinRS test tool. Otherwise it wont work. 

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
